By the end of this assignment your project should meet the following requirements:

  AboutPage.jsx should render general about me information about the show. (Maybe use an API to render this information?)
  CharactersPage.jsx should render a Card BootStrap Component (displaying image and information of said character) for every character within the Rick and Morty API
      Maybe use useState, useEffect, axios, async, map, conditional rendering?
  Routes for each page mentioned above within Reacts Browser Router
  NotFound.jsx should render an error message letting the user know this page does not exist
  Error Route to render NotFound.jsx
  NavBar.jsx should allow users to navigate your project
  Testing with Cypress to ensure all requirements are being met
  Styling from React BootStrap or Tailwind.css
  Have fun!

Warning

The Rick and Morty API uses pagination.

Pagination means the API does not return every matching item in one giant response. Instead, it breaks the data into smaller “pages” of results.

For example, if there are hundreds of characters, the first API request may only return the first page. To get more results, you need to request the next page.

Most list responses from the Rick and Morty API include an info object:

{
  "info": {
    "count": 826,
    "pages": 42,
    "next": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character?page=2",
    "prev": null
  },
  "results": []
}

The info object contains:

    count: the total number of matching items across all pages
    pages: the total number of pages available
    next: the URL for the next page of results, or null if there is no next page
    prev: the URL for the previous page of results, or null if there is no previous page

The actual data you want is usually inside the results array.

For this assignment, do not assume that one API request gives you every result. Check the info object and use next, prev, or the page query parameter when you need additional pages.
